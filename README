The interpreter for ΓΛΩΣΣΑ
It is developed using Antlr 3.2 and Java.

To build the project’s code you will need :
– JDK (6.x+) (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
– Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
It is built-in in Netbeans.
– Antlr 3.2 (http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.2.jar)
You have to place antlr-3.2.jar in glossa/lib/antlr-3.2.jar
(If you have an active internet connection antlr will be downloaded automatically to the correct directory during the first build.)

Then, open a terminal, go to the project's directory (e.g. glossa-interpreter) and give:
ant jar

To run the interpreter:
java -jar dist/glossa-interpreter.jar <input_file>

e.g.:
java -jar dist/glossa-interpreter.jar src/glossa/interpreter/tests/VariablesDeclaration.gls

There are some example input files in src/glossa/interpreter/tests/ .

The project is developed using Netbeans 6.9 but you can use your editor/IDE of choice.
