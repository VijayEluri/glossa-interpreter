The interpreter for ΓΛΩΣΣΑ
It is developed using Antlr 3.2 and Java.

To build the project’s code you will need :
– JDK (6.x+) (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
– Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)
It is built-in in Netbeans.
– Antlr 3.2 (http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.2.jar)
You have to place antlr-3.2.jar in glossa/lib/antlr-3.2.jar
(If you have an active internet connection antlr will be downloaded automatically to the correct directory during the first build.)

The project is developed using Netbeans 6.9 but you can use your editor/IDE of choice.
